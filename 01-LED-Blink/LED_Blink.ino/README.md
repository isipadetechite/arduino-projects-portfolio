# 🔴 LED Blink Experiment

## 📝 Description
LED Blink Experiments (Arduino)

This folder contains my first Arduino experiments with LEDs (LED blink on and off). 
I practiced using `digitalWrite()` and `delay()` to control LEDs in different patterns.  

### 1. Single LED Blink
- One LED connected to pin 13.
- Blinks ON and OFF every 1 second.

### 2. Two LEDs Blink
- Two LEDs connected to pins 12 and 13.
- Both blink ON and OFF together.

### 3. Alternate LED Blink
- Two LEDs connected to pins 12 and 13.
- One blinks while the other is OFF, then they switch.
- Different delay times used to create varying blink speeds.
